# harpia-api

This is small and slow implementation of core project based on JEE for educational purposes. This project acts also as a rest api of [Angular Harpia]https://github.com/orobsonpires/harpia.

In this project, I am trying out BCE for creating decoupled components which should follow the open/close principle, inversion of control and interface segregation.
